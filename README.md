# MyGoodTime

## Description
Created a Day Planner using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Google Fonts. The user is able to enter an event to take place during standard business hours 9am-5pm. The user is able to save the event and reload the page and the event is still displayed. The useer is able to change the event and have it display properly after refresh. The user is able to tell if an event has passed, is currently happening, or will come up based on color coded hour blocks. The user is also able to clear the whole schedule with a "Clear Fields" button.
